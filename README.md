# Conclusion of Independent Study

Since the model is a regression model, I expected within 0.10 of the expected value to be the margin of error. Result of testing the model on the test dataset:

The accuracy problem doesn't return the best results due to the high volume of noise and bad data, however it still preforms well when used to control the vehicle. Even after adding more data however to learn from bad situations, it would still often get stuck on basic manuevers.

Here's an example of it running well on the simple map:

Overall, this project taught me a lot about perservering to figure out new subjects. Similarly the Final Group Project - Road Sign Detection, and overall class material has taken me from understanding the utmost basics of detection, to actually crafting projects that utilize computer vision in multiple different ways.

With this project specifically I was able to improve my overall flow and code management when working with tools like Visual Studio, GitHub, General Documents, and other softwares in which I slowly increased my technical skills.
