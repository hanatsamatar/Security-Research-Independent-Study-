  # East-African Essays


The East African essay section has information on various aspects of cybersecurity in the region. In particular, it contains detailed information on Hormuud, a telecommunications company based in Somalia that has been at the forefront of cybersecurity efforts in the country. 

The essays provide insights into the company's role in securing Somalia's digital infrastructure and the challenges it faces in doing so. Additionally, the section explores the cybersecurity relevance of Hormuud's work and how it is contributing to the broader goal of creating a safe and secure digital ecosystem in East Africa.

Furthermore, I used this section to also include information on Fortinet, a leading cybersecurity solutions provider, and its purpose in the region. The essays delve into how Fortinet is helping to address the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by East African countries, including the need to secure mobile networks and combat cybercrime. The section also looks at Fortinet's future vision for the region, including its plans to continue innovating and developing new solutions to stay ahead of emerging threats.

Overall, the East African essay section provides a comprehensive view of the cybersecurity landscape in the region, highlighting the efforts of companies like Hormuud and Fortinet to create a safer digital environment. It offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities facing East Africa in terms of cybersecurity and serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in this important topic.

# Security+ Program 


The Security+ Program section is a collection of my notes from a CompTIA prep course taught by Mike Chapple. The course is divided into various certification preparation sections, each covering a different aspect of cybersecurity. These sections include:

Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities,

Secure code design and implementation, 

Cryptography design and implementation,  

Identity and access management design and implementation, 

Network Security Design and Implementation, 

Physical Security Design Implementation, 

Governance, Risk, and compliance, 

Endpoint Security Design and Implementation,  

Cloud Security Design and Implementation,

 # SQL Database Program

The SQL-MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence section is a collection of my resources and documentation aimed at providing insights into using SQL and MySQL for data analytics and business intelligence. While the section is mostly completed, there are ongoing efforts to dive deeper into the topics covered and provide more detailed information.

In particular, the section was inspired from the documentation by Christopher Ijams on ethical penetration testing for AAA Washington, which offers valuable insights into the importance of ethical hacking and penetration testing in ensuring the security of digital infrastructure. The documentation covers various aspects of ethical hacking, including vulnerability scanning, password cracking, and social engineering, and provides practical guidance on how to conduct these activities in an ethical and responsible manner.

Overall, the SQL-MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence section is a valuable resource for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of how SQL and MySQL can be used for data analytics and business intelligence, as well as for those interested in ethical hacking and penetration testing.

  # Fortinet Basics

The section of my research covers the fundamental basics of Fortinet, including its history, mission, and product offerings. It also delves into the key features and benefits of Fortinet's products, such as their ability to provide integrated security, simplify management, and reduce costs. Some of the key Fortinet products that are covered in the section include the FortiGate firewall, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiManager. Overall, the section also goes into detail about the different deployment scenarios for Fortinet's products, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid deployments.

# Threats, Risks, Mitigation

Protecting infrastructure is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, and requires a comprehensive understanding of the various threats, risks, and mitigations involved. In this page of notes, I dive into some of the key considerations for protecting infrastructure, including the various types of threats that organizations may face, the risks associated with these threats, and the different mitigations that can be put in place to reduce these risks.

# Website Penetration

The Website Penetration Tests/Ethical Hacking section of the cybersecurity independent study explores the basics of multiple software tools that are commonly used in ethical hacking and penetration testing. These include port scanners, vulnerability scanners, web application scanners, password cracking tools, exploitation frameworks, and network sniffers and protocol analyzers. The section provides examples of popular tools within each category, such as Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite, John the Ripper, Metasploit, and Wireshark. Additionally, the section frequently references the capstone project provided by the professor as a means of understanding key terms and concepts in the context of a real-world scenario. By learning about and practicing with these tools, students can gain a deeper understanding of how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in various types of systems and applications, ultimately enhancing their skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing.

# Conclusion of Independent Study

Overall, this project taught me a lot about perservering to figure out new subjects. 

With this project specifically I was able to improve my overall flow and code management when working with tools like Visual Studio, GitHub, General Documents, and other softwares in which I slowly increased my technical skills.

# What I Would Like to Continue

I will continue to expand, through this repository, potential technological implementations I could see being adopted and utilized. I think it's a region that's often overlooked, despite its rapidly growing digital landscape and untapped potential. There's just so much that could be done to improve cybersecurity in Africa, and I'd love to be a part of that effort. I'm particularly interested in exploring the current state of cybersecurity in different African countries and identifying the common threats and risks faced by businesses and individuals in the region. It's important to look at the effectiveness of existing policies and frameworks as well, to see what's working and what's not. I'm also curious about emerging technologies and trends in Africa and how they may impact cybersecurity in the future. 

Overall, I think there's a lot of opportunity for me to contribute to the field of cybersecurity by conducting research and analysis on the unique challenges and opportunities faced in Africa.
