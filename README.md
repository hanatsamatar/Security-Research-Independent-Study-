# Introduction 

Welcome to my Github Repository for the Cybersecurity Independent Study. This repository is intended to be a comprehensive resource for all things related to cybersecurity, with a specific focus on East Africa. Here, you will find summaries and essays on various cybersecurity sectors, ranging from network security to cryptography, as well as deep dives into specific topics such as malware analysis and incident response. The aim is to provide a thorough understanding of the current state of cybersecurity, both globally and within East Africa, as well as its relevance and importance in the region.

 # East-African Essays

The East African essay section has information on various aspects of cybersecurity in the region. In particular, it contains detailed information on Hormuud, a telecommunications company based in Somalia that has been at the forefront of cybersecurity efforts in the country. 

The essays provide insights into the company's role in securing Somalia's digital infrastructure and the challenges it faces in doing so. Additionally, the section explores the cybersecurity relevance of Hormuud's work and how it is contributing to the broader goal of creating a safe and secure digital ecosystem in East Africa.

Furthermore, I used this section to also include information on Fortinet, a leading cybersecurity solutions provider, and its purpose in the region. The essays delve into how Fortinet is helping to address the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by East African countries, including the need to secure mobile networks and combat cybercrime. The section also looks at Fortinet's future vision for the region, including its plans to continue innovating and developing new solutions to stay ahead of emerging threats.

Overall, the East African essay section provides a comprehensive view of the cybersecurity landscape in the region, highlighting the efforts of companies like Hormuud and Fortinet to create a safer digital environment. It offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities facing East Africa in terms of cybersecurity and serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in this important topic.

  # General Essays


The General essays section contains detailed information on a range of topics, including cloud security, network operations, security operations, secure networking, zero trust access, and open ecosystems. The essays provide insights into the latest trends and best practices in each of these areas, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that organizations face when securing their digital infrastructure.

For example, the section explores the latest developments in cloud security and how organizations can ensure the safety and security of their data when leveraging cloud-based services. It also looks at the importance of secure networking and how organizations can create a robust and resilient network architecture that protects against cyber threats.

Overall, the General essays section provides a wealth of information on a range of important cybersecurity topics, offering valuable insights and practical guidance; a takeaway which inspired my pursuit for understanding these specific mesh architecture types.

# Security+ Program 

The Security+ Program section is a collection of my notes from a CompTIA prep course taught by Mike Chapple. The course is divided into various certification preparation sections, each covering a different aspect of cybersecurity. These sections include:

Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities,
Secure code design and implementation,  
Cryptography design and implementation,  
Identity and access management design and implementation, 
Network Security Design and Implementation, 
Physical Security Design Implementation, 
Governance, Risk, and compliance, 
Endpoint Security Design and Implementation,  
Cloud Security Design and Implementation,

# Conclusion of Independent Study

Since the model is a regression model, I expected within 0.10 of the expected value to be the margin of error. Result of testing the model on the test dataset:

The accuracy problem doesn't return the best results due to the high volume of noise and bad data, however it still preforms well when used to control the vehicle. Even after adding more data however to learn from bad situations, it would still often get stuck on basic manuevers.

Here's an example of it running well on the simple map:

Overall, this project taught me a lot about perservering to figure out new subjects. Similarly the Final Group Project - Road Sign Detection, and overall class material has taken me from understanding the utmost basics of detection, to actually crafting projects that utilize computer vision in multiple different ways.

With this project specifically I was able to improve my overall flow and code management when working with tools like Visual Studio, GitHub, General Documents, and other softwares in which I slowly increased my technical skills.
